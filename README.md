## Hi there! 👋

I'm Fateme, a Machine Learning engineer who loves building AI solutions for real problems. Currently working on some cool medical imaging projects.

### What I'm up to
- 🧠 Building Deep Learning Models for Alzheimer's prediction using MRI data from ADNI dataset - experimenting with CNNs and other architectures to detect early signs
- 🗣️ Working on speech-based Alzheimer's detection using the DementiaBank repository - it's fascinating how speech patterns can reveal cognitive changes
- 📊 Creating insurance prediction models with TabNet and XGBoost
- 👩‍🏫 Teaching ML/AI to 100+ students as a TA
- 🎓 Pursuing M.Sc. in Computer Science (AI focus)

### Languages and tools I work with
Python • TensorFlow • PyTorch • Django • Go • PostgreSQL • Docker 

### Recent learning
Just completed some cool courses on diffusion models and prompt engineering. 
<br>
Always learning something new in AI!
